# Block preconditioners for a multiphase system 
This repository sets up the necessary operators required to solve a multiphase system of equations. The aim of this project is to identify a feasible block preconditioner for the multiphase system.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine. This project requires Python 3.8 or higher.

## Set-up a virtual environment
On macOS/Linux:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install required dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run the code
e.g. `python solve.py`
